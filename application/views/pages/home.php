    <p class=" text-center home_section_body">Blogs are still alive and well, as people in the Internet age find themselves with easy access to myriad ways of voicing opinions. This is one such outlet, where you can create post categories, and then make blog posts in that category, comment on other users posts, and upload pictures with your posts. Other standard features to registered users are the ability to delete post categories you created (though this still needs work, as it would delete all posts in that category, even from other users), delete your own posts, and of course edit them. The site is still being updated, and ideas are welcome! Thank you for visiting.</p>
